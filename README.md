Activity 1 - Python Inventory System

The problem requires creating a simple inventory management program in Python using basic data structures and control flow. 
The program must store item names in a list and their corresponding prices in a dictionary, ensuring that both structures stay synchronized. 
The system should allow users to add new items by entering an item name and price, while preventing duplicates to maintain accurate data. 
It should also allow users to update the price of an existing item by entering its name and providing a new price; if the item does not exist, the program must display an appropriate error message. 
The menu must operate inside a loop so users can repeatedly choose actions until they decide to exit. 
Additionally, the program must use conditionals to handle menu selections and try–except blocks to validate numeric price inputs and prevent runtime errors. 
The final output should replicate a simple console-based inventory interface without including any deletion or stock-tracking features.
